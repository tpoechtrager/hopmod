HOPMOD PythonBot (c) by Michael, Commands (c) by Thomas

To run the Bot you need to have Python and Twistd for Python installed.
Once you have them installed, you can run the Bot with:
 # twistd -ny hopmod_bot.tac &
 
 
Commandlist:

.servers -> prints a sorted list of the connected servers

Admin Commands (requires operator in the channel)

Adding Servers:

Checkout config.py for that

'server1': { <- name of the server
    'host':          'localhost', <- host of the server
    'port':           28795, <- irc listener port (gameport + 10)
    'password':       '', <- irc listener password (you can define that password in the config of hopmod)
    'format':         '\00301%s\003', <- color for the bot
    'reconnect_time': 60, <- reconnect time in seconds, if the server was disconnect or restarted
},

Attention: Don't copy that example to the config without removing the comments!
